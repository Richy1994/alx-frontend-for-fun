ACCESSIBILITY


By the W3C definition, accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can: perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and contribute to the Web.

One good example for accessibility is if you can use your website without looking at it. How would all the features and details you spent hours on developing work if you couldnt use your eyesight to consume the content or use the mouse to interact with it? Imagine instead that you would need to listen to a screen reader that describes the UI and that navigation may not be through the traditional mouse or keyboard input.
